# FacE-ERaTA-ONLINE
An web application that uses Facial Emotion Recognition in order to rate the expressions of theatre actors and help them improve in a gamified manner.

## How to run
This application was developed on a Windows 10 PC using Python 3.11.1 and PyCharm Community edition. In order to make its installation as trouble free as possible, I suggest you use the same setup.
1) Download the project onto your PC from "Code -> Download ZIP". Unzip the downloaded project.
2) Navigate to "FacE-ERaTA online/" where main.py is. At the top of the file explorer where the path to the folder is displayed, delete the path and type "cmd", then hit enter. A Command Line window will appear, with the file system already looking inside the FacE-ERaTA online folder. Alternatively, open up a new Command Line window and navigate to the FacE-ERaTA folder on your PC.
3) This step is all about downloading the dependencies needed for this project to run. If you already satisfy the following requirements, feel free to skip this step.<br>
First of all, make sure you have Python installed on your PC. Ideally version 3.11.1, the version on which this app was built. Then type the following commands:<br>
   -pip install Pillow<br>
   -pip install opencv-contrib-python<br>
   -pip install deepface<br>
   -pip install plotly<br>
   -pip install tf-keras<br>
   -pip install -U kaleido

4) Type the following command "python main.py"
